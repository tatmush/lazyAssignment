ls	--       List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci‐       fied.       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options       too.rm	--       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of rm.  rm removes each       specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given,  and  there  are  more       than  three  files  or  the  -r,  -R, or --recursive are given, then rm       prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.   Ifmkdir	--       Create the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist.       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options       too.       -m, --mode=MODErmdir	--       Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.       --ignore-fail-on-non-empty              ignore each failure that is solely because a directorypwd	--       Print the full filename of the current working directory.       -L, --logical              use PWD from environment, even if it contains symlinks       -P, --physicalln	--       In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In       the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the       3rd  and  4th  forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create       hard links by default, symbolic links  with  --symbolic.   By  default,       each  destination  (name  of  new link) should not already exist.  When       creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links  can  holdchmod	--       This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the       file mode bits of each given file  according  to  mode,  which  can  be       either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number       representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.       The format of a symbolic mode is  [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...],  whereumask	--       umask()  sets  the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to       mask & 0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of mask are used), and       returns the previous value of the mask.       The  umask  is  used  by open(2), mkdir(2), and other system calls that       create files to modify the permissions placed on newly created files orping	--       ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit       an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.   ECHO_REQUEST  datagrams       (``pings'')  have  an  IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval       and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes  used  to  fill  out  the       packet.cut	--       Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options       too.sort	--       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options       too.  Ordering options:which	--       which returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be exe‐       cuted in the current environment, had its arguments been given as  com‐       mands  in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell.  It does this by searching       the PATH for executable files matching the names of the  arguments.  It       does not follow symbolic links.grep	--       grep searches the named input FILEs for lines containing a match to the       given PATTERN.  If no files are specified, or if the file “-” is given,       grep  searches  standard  input.   By default, grep prints the matching       lines.       In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are  the  samewhereis	--       whereis locates the binary, source and manual files for  the  specified       command  names.  The supplied names are first stripped of leading path‐       name components and any (single) trailing extension of  the  form  .ext       (for  example:  .c)  Prefixes  of s.  resulting from use of source code       control are also dealt with.   whereis  then  attempts  to  locate  the       desired  program in the standard Linux places, and in the places speci‐w	--       w  displays  information  about the users currently on the machine, and       their processes.  The header shows, in this order,  the  current  time,       how  long  the  system  has  been running, how many users are currently       logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15  min‐       utes.who	--       Print information about users who are currently logged in.       -a, --all              same as -b -d --login -p -r -t -T -u       -b, --bootwhoami	--       Print  the  user  name  associated  with the current effective user ID.       Same as id -un.       --help display this help and exit       --versionlast	--       last  searches  back through the /var/log/wtmp file (or the file desig‐       nated by the -f option) and displays a list of all users logged in (and       out)  since  that  file was created.  One or more usernames and/or ttys       can be given, in which case last will show only  the  entries  matching       those  arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the       same as last tty0.file	--     This manual page documents version 5.25 of the file command.     file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three     sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests,     and language tests.  The first test that succeeds causes the file type to     be printed.strings	--       For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable character       sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with       the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character.       Depending upon how the strings program was configured it will default       to either displaying all the printable sequences that it can find intop	--       The  top  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running       system.  It can display system summary information as  well  as  a       list  of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux       kernel.  The types of system summary  information  shown  and  the       types,  order  and size of information displayed for processes are       all user configurable and that configuration can be  made  persis‐ps	--       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed       information, use top(1) instead.       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:nice	--       Run  COMMAND  with an adjusted niceness, which affects process schedul‐       ing.  With no COMMAND, print the  current  niceness.   Niceness  values       range  from  -20 (most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable       to the process).       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  optionsnohup	--       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.       --help display this help and exit       --version              output version information and exitkill	--       The  default  signal  for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available       signals.  Particularly useful signals include  HUP,  INT,  KILL,  STOP,       CONT,  and  0.   Alternate  signals may be specified in three ways: -9,       -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be  used  to  choose  whole       process  groups; see the PGID column in ps command output.  A PID of -1       is special; it indicates all processes except the kill  process  itselfsignal	--       The behavior of signal() varies across UNIX versions, and has also var‐       ied historically across different versions of Linux.   Avoid  its  use:       use sigaction(2) instead.  See Portability below.       signal() sets the disposition of the signal signum to handler, which is       either SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL, or the address of a  programmer-defined  func‐more	--       more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This       version is especially primitive.  Users  should  realize  that  less(1)       provides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.OPTIONS       Options are also taken from the environment variable MORE (make sure toless	--       Less is a program similar to more (1), but it has many  more  features.       Less  does  not  have to read the entire input file before starting, so       with large input files it starts up faster than text  editors  like  vi       (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on       a variety of terminals.  There is even  limited  support  for  hardcopy       terminals.   (On  a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed atifconfig	--       Ifconfig  is  used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.       It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.  After that,       it  is  usually  only  needed  when  debugging or when system tuning is       needed.       If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the  status  of  the  cur‐arp	--       Arp  manipulates or displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache.       It can add entries to the table, delete one or display the current con‐       tent.       ARP  stands  for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the       media access control address of a network neighbour for  a  given  IPv4nslookup	--       Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers.  Nslookup       has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode allows       the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and       domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode       is used to print just the name and requested information for a host or       domain.cat	--       Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.       -A, --show-all              equivalent to -vETuname	--       Print certain system information.  With no OPTION, same as -s.       -a, --all              print  all  information,  in the following order, except omit -p              and -i if unknown:history	--       Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU  His‐       tory  library is able to keep track of those lines, associate arbitrary       data with each line, and utilize information  from  previous  lines  in       composing new ones.HISTORY EXPANSIONnetstat	--       Netstat  prints  information about the Linux networking subsystem.  The       type of information printed is controlled by  the  first  argument,  as       follows:   (none)       By  default,  netstat  displays  a  list of open sockets.  If you don'tifconfig	--       Ifconfig  is  used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.       It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.  After that,       it  is  usually  only  needed  when  debugging or when system tuning is       needed.       If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the  status  of  the  cur‐dig	--       dig (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating       DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that       are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS       administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its       flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend       to have less functionality than dig.man	--       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to  man  is       normally  the  name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page       associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A       section,  if  provided, will direct man to look only in that section of       the manual.  The default action is to search in all  of  the  available       sections following a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 5lsof	--       Lsof  revision 4.89 lists on its standard output file information about       files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:            Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]            FreeBSD 8.[234], 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0 for AMD64-based systems            Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systemscrontab	--       crontab  is  the  program used to install, deinstall or list the tables       used to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.   Each  user  can  have       their    own    crontab,    and    though    these    are    files   in       /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.       If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed  (one  usernc	--     The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun     involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.  It can open TCP connections,     send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scan‐     ning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6.  Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts     nicely, and separates error messages onto standard error instead of send‐     ing them to standard output, as telnet(1) does with some.uniq	--       Filter  adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input), writing       to OUTPUT (or standard output).       With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence.       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  optionsid	--       Print  user and group information for the specified USER, or (when USER       omitted) for the current user.       -a     ignore, for compatibility with other versions       -Z, --contextgroups	--       Print  group memberships for each USERNAME or, if no USERNAME is speci‐       fied, for the current process (which may differ if the groups  database       has changed).       --help display this help and exitdf	--       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of df.  df displays the       amount of disk space available on the file system containing each  file       name  argument.   If  no file name is given, the space available on all       currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk space  is  shown  in  1K       blocks  by  default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is       set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.du	--       Summarize disk usage of the set of FILEs, recursively for directories.       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options       too.       -0, --nulltouch	--       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to the current       time.       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c  or  -h       is supplied.
